# 📝 Entre Planner

My first developing experience with Flutter includes an entrepreneurship planner tool designed to help new entrepreneurs manage their tasks, review their finances, and receive AI-powered tips.

## 🚀 Features

To-Do List Management: Stay organized by adding, viewing, and tracking your to-do items. Mark items as high priority to bring them to the front of your to-do list, or delete them entirely when you're done. Perfect for managing daily business tasks and deadlines.

Financial Tracker: Manage your business's financials by adding income and expenses, and calculating net profit.

AI Recommendations: Leverage AI-powered recommendations to improve your business strategy and optimize resources.
